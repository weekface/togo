Togo
====

 Minimalist todo tool written in Go.

### Installation

Gopher can use go-get:

```bash 
$ go get github.com/weekface/togo
```

Other users:

Find [the appropriate package](https://github.com/weekface/togo/releases) for your system and download it. Togo is packaged as a "zip" archive.

After downloading Togo, unzip the package. Copy the `togo` binary to somewhere on the PATH so that it can be executed. On Unix systems, `~/bin` and `/usr/local/bin` are common installation directories, depending on if you want to restrict the install to a single user or expose it to the entire system. On Windows systems, you can put it wherever you would like.
